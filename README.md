# Introduction

This repository contains the data and replication files for my three-part Substack (https://larssoneg.substack.com/) series that analyzes the ESPN NFL Football Power Index. Please feel free to use the data set and related files if you are interested in exploring the data further. A brief overview of the repository contents is below. 

Note: I prefix my R file names with numbers to indicate the order in which they should be run if you want to rebuild everything from scratch.

# Data

The `data` folder contains the raw HTML files, the R script for scraping the FPI data `0-scrape-raw-html.R`, and the primary data set of FPI values used in the analysis `weekly-fpi-2020-2022.csv`. See part (1/3) of the Substack series for more details. 

# Analysis

The `analysis` folder contains the code and related outputs for the exploratory data analysis (part 2/3 on Substack) and main results (part 3/3).
